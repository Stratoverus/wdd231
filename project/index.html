            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <p>Here are some answers to some popular questions.</p>
            <h4>How do you choose which Pok√©mon cards to collect?</h4>
            <p>I pretty much try to pick up more modern cards, because I do play the card game and want cards that could be relevant to me.</p>
            <h4>Where do you find your Pok√©mon Cards?</h4>
            <p>I am part of a group where we can update each other and when new cards are restocked.</p>
            <h4>What‚Äôs your rarest or favorite card in your collection?</h4>
            <p>My favorite card? I have a few that are my favorites right now, I'd have to say my Dragapult Ex card.</p>
            <h4>How do you keep your cards safe and in good condition?</h4>
            <p>I have penny sleeves for any card that is worth around or over 50 cents. Then I put those in a binder. For more expensive cards, such as 15 dollars or more, I put them also in a top loader.</p>
            <h4>Can I trade with you or share my collection?</h4>
            <p>Yes! I accept trades! Feel free to look through my collection!</p>
            <h4>Are all the cards on this website part of your real collection?</h4>
            <p>Yes they are! It has taken AGES to get all of the information, but this is my collection!</p>
